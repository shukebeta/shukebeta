## 💻 Computer things 
- I am experienced in C#/PHP/Javascript, which means I have been working on many projects using these languages. I am familiar with Python/Delphi/Java, which means I know their syntax very well, and have done some tiny projects with them. I also write scripts in Bash scripts that help me out from boring repetitive tasks.
- I know SVN very well, but Git is my favorite VCS tool. 
- I love docker, if a service can be deployed by docker-compose, I would like to deploy it that way.
- I find myself writing more and more back-end code using node.js
- I am the Chinese Translator of three programming books, which are:
  - Pro PHP and jQuery (深入PHP与jQuery开发)
  - Pro jQuery (2nd) (精通 jQuery)
  - Smashing jQuery (精彩绝伦的jQuery)
- I am also the technical Reviewer / Proofreader of the classic Javascript book "DOM Scripting" (Javascript DOM编程艺术第二版), I paid a lot of effort on these books, and I am happy that they have helped so many web developers. [Reference](https://www.ituring.com.cn/search/result?q=%E9%AD%8F%E5%BF%A0)

## 🌀 Projects

- [ytabc.com](https://ytabc.com) I am currently working on this cross-border e-commerce platform as a full stack developer. The backend of this project is using .NET Core 3.1 and the front-end of the project is using Vue.js.
- [corpus.shukebeta.com](https://corpus.shukebeta.com) This small project is actually an one PHP file project, but it's really useful for learning new words. You could easily find sample sentences for a specific word or phrase in English or Chinese in seconds. [show me the code](https://github.com/shukebeta/ec_corpus)

## 🤖 About me
- I love straightforward communication, and hate wasting time.
- Sometimes I think I am still a boy, though I am already a father of two boys.
- I love playing Ingress game, hiking, and camping in my spare time.
- I hold a post-study work visa that expires Feb. 2022, so I have the right work for any employer in New Zealand.
- **I’m currently on the search for new opportunities and would love to collaborate.**
