## 💻 Computer things 
- I am experienced in C#/Javascript/PHP, which means I have been working on many projects using these languages. I am familiar with Python/Delphi/Java, which means I know their syntax very well and have done some small projects with them. I also write scripts in Bash scripts that help me out from boring, repetitive tasks.
- Git is my favourite VCS tool since 2011. 
- Docker is my love; if a service can be deployed by docker-compose, I would like to deploy it that way.
- C# is the latest sharp tool in my toolbox, I mainly write C# code since 2020, while the secondary important language to me is Javascript.
- Translating is my hobby, I translated and published three programming books, which are:
  - Pro PHP and jQuery (深入PHP与jQuery开发)
  - Pro jQuery (2nd) (精通 jQuery)
  - Smashing jQuery (精彩绝伦的jQuery)
- I am the technical Reviewer / Proofreader of the classic Javascript book “DOM Scripting” (Javascript DOM编程艺术第二版), I paid a lot of effort into these books, and I am happy that they have helped so many web developers. [Reference](https://www.ituring.com.cn/search/result?q=%E9%AD%8F%E5%BF%A0)

- [XE.com](https://xe.com) I am working on the core team in this well-known company, mainly using C# and JavaScript.
